Week 1 
This week I used AI to explain to me what object oriented programming is in a simple and digestible manner. I also asked AI to explain the concept of f strings and provide me with code examples in Python to me.

Week 2
This week I used AI to write a Python script to clean some messy datasets that I have collected. My Python script cleans a user-specified CSV file by removing duplicate and incomplete rows, then saves the clean data to a new file and reports a summary of the changes.

Week 3
This week I used AI to generate an image of a Corgi. I was extremely detailed with my prompt because I wanted to recreate an image of a corgi i saw on google images via text to image generation. The google image i wanted to recreate was this one: https://share.google/images/gi7j3UQgMg2p65ko9 and I would say that the AI image was fairly similar to the google image I wanted to recreate, which goes to show how being detailed with prompting will yield you better results.

Week 4
This week I used AI to explain to me the difference between what a class and an object is in an easy to understand manner. I also asked AI to provide examples to help me better understand what the difference between a class and an object is.

Week 5
This week I used AI to explain to me the basics of the Pandas library in Python as my group will be using that library for our group project for this INST 326 class. I asked AI to provide example use cases and code blocks for me to be able to easily understand the Pandas library.

Week 6
This week I used AI to explain to me what class methods and static methods are tp better prepare me to do this week's assignment and projects. Here is my chat with AI: https://chatgpt.com/share/68fabac3-c7ec-8013-8dcd-03720addec51

Week 7
This week I used AI to explain to me how error handling works in Python. I asked AI this because I was struggling to understand the logic behind error handling and the explanation it provided really claririfed the concept for me.
