Week 1 
This week I used AI to explain to me what object oriented programming is in a simple and digestible manner. I also asked AI to explain the concept of f strings and provide me with code examples in Python to me. Here is the link to my chat with AI: https://chatgpt.com/share/68c221c9-029c-8013-ab11-b8110d4a53f7.

Week 2
This week I used AI to write a Python script to clean some messy datasets that I have collected. My Python script cleans a user-specified CSV file by removing duplicate and incomplete rows, then saves the clean data to a new file and reports a summary of the changes.

Week 3
This week I used AI to generate an image of a Corgi. I was extremely detailed with my prompt because I wanted to recreate an image of a corgi i saw on google images via text to image generation. The google image i wanted to recreate was this one: https://share.google/images/gi7j3UQgMg2p65ko9 and I would say that the AI image was fairly similar to the google image I wanted to recreate, which goes to show how being detailed with prompting will yield you better results.
