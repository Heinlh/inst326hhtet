Week 1 
This week I used AI to explain to me what object oriented programming is in a simple and digestible manner. I also asked AI to explain the concept of f strings and provide me with code examples in Python to me.

Week 2
This week I used AI to write a Python script to clean some messy datasets that I have collected. My Python script cleans a user-specified CSV file by removing duplicate and incomplete rows, then saves the clean data to a new file and reports a summary of the changes.
